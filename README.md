# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

##### This repo explains how the file run_analysis.R works.

1. Download the Samsung files from <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip> 
2. Then, add the downloaded files from the github repository in the same folder as the extracted files from point 1.
3. There are three files: **run_analysis.R**, **README.md** and **CodeBook.md**. To Run the file just use *RStudio* or open a terminal and type: 
	```R
	$ R
	> source("run_analysis.R")
	```
4. This will create a folder named *merged*. Inside there will be two files **filteredTable.txt** and **SummarizedTable.txt**.
